Inspired by the games "Operation: Innerspace" and "Starscape", Interspace will be a top down shooter with added RPG and RTS elements and a lot of AI and Procedural content.

To run:
1. Install Love2D version 0.8.0 or above. (Ubuntu 12.04 has an older version but there are .deb downloads and a PPA on the Love2d site.) https://love2d.org/
2. Put all files and sub-dirs into one folder (Interspace)
3. Get the HUMP libraries and place in a folder called hump in the main folder. http://vrld.github.com/hump/#download
  (Note: If cloning with git, Hump is linked as a submodule. This link explains how to clone the submodule: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules )
4. To run either 
  a. In Linux command line, run "love Interspace" from parent directory. 
  b. In Windows and Linux, zip the folder, rename to a .love file and double-click to run (may need to set as executable in Linux)
  c. In Windows, drag folder onto Love desktop shortcut (not tried this)

Code should be well commented and my notes are in the "notes" sub folder. Might give an idea as to where my weird brain is taking this thing.
