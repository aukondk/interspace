Notes of things I want to do with Interspace.


*System generation
  Create system for generating file/operating system procedurally. Able to plug in to any game that needs it.

*Levels need to be made either procedurally or manually. Perhaps names of ships and systems etc can be based on locality (USS Liverpool)

*Links to computer setting
  Names (Weapon could be "Logic Bomb" etc)
  Solar Systems are one computer. Planets large folders etc
  Currency are "Cycles"
  Gates/Links between solar systems
  
*Campaign Gameplay
  freeroaming between solar systems, some places require reputation or good defences to pass though safely.
  Shoot asteroids to get resources
  Defend against nasties, take goodies
  Attack neutral or friendly for goodies, but reduce reputation and make enemies.
  Trade
  Upgrade/trade in/buy ships
  Build and Expand
  Join or make own faction
  NPC or Faction Missions
  Board and takeover ships
  Tow deralicts to trade or fix up.

*Map
  Network map, boxes to click on to explore network and eventually internet. Also see who "owns" territory.
  
*Weapons systems
  Hitscan
  Rockets (dumb and smart)
  Lazers
  Area Effect
  Harpoon
  Turret control (good for capital ships)
  Shield
  Cloak
  Gravity repel/inverter/blackhole
  Ion Cannon (to disable and board)
  Bombs
  
*Engines
  Warp
  Hyper
  IID (Infinite Improbility)

*Assist Systems
  Autopilot
  Course projection
  Mouse control
  Eject

*Ships
  Different limits to type of weapons, engines, thrusters
  Classes
    Fighters
      Small, fast, start with this, dock with larger ships
    Carriers
      Can hold lots of smaller ships
    Frigates
      Hold only one fighter but good for cargo
    Warships
      Shitloads of weapons and defence
    EVA (from ejection or small monsters)
      weak but some teams could use many to overwhelm/board large craft

*Factions (could join and be given missions by AI, Go up in rank and take over. You have reputation with all of them which judges each of their responses to you)
  Empire
    Nasty & pointy (a la Star Wars)
  Federation
    Fair
    Explorers
    No trade (a la Star Trek)
  Alliance
  Coalition
  Collective (Borglike)
    Hivemind (interesting AI?)
    Amoral
    Join when assimulated (interesting)
  Virus
  Union
  East Internet Trading Company
    Solar sail ships
      Fuel only needed if solar winds not in right dir
  Pirates
  Independent
    This is you when you start campaign
  Make own faction.
    Registration costs but allows you to employ AI workers
  Monsters
    Roam around
    Primal AI
    Some are pack hunters
    Sharks
    Octopus
    Snakes
  
*Control and AI
  Player and AI use same commands to control Objects
  Player can use different control systems (mouse driven RTS style with AI ships)
  Player and AI can "take control" of all objects if commands exist in object.
  Data about AI "mind" like name, temperament generated and passed to make new AI player. Perhaps selected by Command player/AI before battle.

*Communication system
  Dynamic Audio/Text taunts/commentary from AI
  Radio scanner can be bought to "listen in" to enemy orders
  
*Slomo effect
  something to do with dt, multiply by slomo variable.
  slow down action when drama happens, death of final baddie? Near miss?
  
*Intro
  Logos
  Scrolling playfield
  Title

*Menu
  Ships fighting in background?

*Background
  Parallax (new camera system from scratch?)
  Grid, stars, fractals? system generated?
  
*Boss AI
  Like an RTS player, gives orders to ships based on mission and status of battlefield.
  Boss could be attached to particular craft so lower ranks become unorganised when flagship destroyed.
  Could have multiple ranks (ship captains, squad leaders etc)
  
*Resources
  Icons worth "cycles"-currency
    Collected from destroying asteroids
    Mining asteroids gives more
    Collect from destroying other ships
  Solar energy?
  Fuel
    Used for ships
    Costs to refuel

*Bases (built by you or others)
